# Project 1
## Day 1 of project 1
Hi guys, Today I will be creating a website for Over 25. For those that are not familiar with Over 25, Over 25 is a Kenyan female group. 4 ladies, Content creators and Influencers. Last time I checked they sold t-shirts, sweatshirts, hoodies branded their group name 'Over 25' and I thought, why not make them a website so that people could order their hoodies etc. from there. 

I will use React.Js, a framework of Js. Learning while doing.
Happy hacking!!

## Day 2 of project 1
Today I worked on the about and contact sections... 
Still trying to learn about react props and state so as to simplify my work.
